### Welcome to the QuATOMs group git 👋

The Quantum & Artificial inTelligence design Of Materials ([QuATOMs](https://dannyvanpoucke.be/quatoms-group/)) group was created in October 2022, as part of the materials chemistry group in the faculty of science at [UHasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/en/). The group is embedded in the [Instute for Materials Research (IMO-IMOMEC)](https://www.uhasselt.be/en/instituten-en/imo-imomec), and provides quantum chemical support and predictions in materials research. It is the interdisciplinary computational materials research 💻 group at IMO-IMOMEC with interest in both materials physics⚛️ and materials chemistry🧪. The group is lead by Prof. dr. dr. Danny Vanpoucke ([git](https://github.com/DannyVanpoucke), [web](https://dannyvanpoucke.be/)), and currently counts 3 PhD's and 1 Post doc.

As our work focusses on AI and DFT, and provides classes in computational and quantum chemistry, repositories related to these topics will be migrated to this group (once considered stable enough).
